# Neural Networks in C
• Developed a neural network which is capable of learning various logic gates, including AND, OR, and NAND gates, in addition to XOR.
• Implemented forward and backward propagation to adjust the weights to minimizing the loss function.
• Used finite differences to calculate gradients for updating weights, optimizing the network parameters for accurate
predictions.
