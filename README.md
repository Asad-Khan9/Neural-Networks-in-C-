Neural Networks in C
Explore the world of neural networks with this repository containing implementations in C. This project is aimed at both learning the fundamentals of deep learning and having fun with coding. The neural network models implemented here include basic concepts such as linear regression and may extend to more advanced architectures over time.

Key Features:
C Implementation: Dive into the core of neural network concepts using the C programming language.
Educational: Understand the basics of neural networks, gradient descent, and optimization techniques through hands-on coding.
Versatility: Implementations cover a range of simple to more complex neural network architectures.
Experimentation: Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to see the impact on model performance.
